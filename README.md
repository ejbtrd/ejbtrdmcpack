# ejbtrd's minecraft modpack

> This is a simple modpack with mods that I use on a regular basis.

## How to install

Currently there are two ways to install this modpack.

### As MultiMC instance

First way supports automatic updates, but requires MultiMC:

1. Download [MultiMC instance ZIP](https://github.com/ejbtrd/ejbtrdmcpack/raw/main/ejbtrdmcpack.zip)
2. Drag zip to MultiMC window and confirm import
3. Launch and enjoy! 

> Instance will be updated every time you launch it

### As Modrinth modpack file

Modrinth modpack file doesn't support automatic updates, but it's compatible with more launchers.

Most of them require to just drag and drop the modpack file into launcher window, however detailed instructions for each of those launcher can be found in [Modrinth documentation](https://docs.modrinth.com/docs/modpacks/playing_modpacks/)
