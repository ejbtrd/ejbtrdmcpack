# ejbtrd's minecraft modpack

> This is a simple modpack with mods that I use on a regular basis.

## How to install

Currently there are two ways to install this modpack:

### As MultiMC instance

First way supports automatic updates, but requires MultiMC:

1. Download [MultiMC instance ZIP](https://github.com/ejbtrd/ejbtrdmcpack/raw/main/MultiMC/ejbtrdmcpack.zip)
2. Drag and drop zip to MultiMC window, then confirm import
3. Launch and enjoy! 

> Instance will be updated every time you launch it

### As Modrinth modpack

Modrinth modpack doesn't support automatic updates, but it's compatible with more launchers.

Latest modrinth modpack can be found in [releases](https://github.com/ejbtrd/ejbtrdmcpack/releases/latest)
Most of launcher require to just drag and drop the modpack into the window, however detailed instructions for each of those launchers can be found in [Modrinth documentation](https://docs.modrinth.com/docs/modpacks/playing_modpacks/)
